## International passenger travel in US

This script allows us to analyze passenger data from the US Customs and Border Control over the last three years.
Specifically, it allows us to break out the figures for citizens vs non-citizens passing through border security at international airports.

The raw data for various airports is available through CBP at https://awt.cbp.gov/
